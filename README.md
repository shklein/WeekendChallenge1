# WeekendChallenge1

For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employee data, including their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much weâ€™re spending each month.

Base Functionality
The application should first have an input form that collects:

* The Employee's First and Last name
* The Employee's ID Number
* The Employee's Job Title
* The Employee's Salary (Yearly)

The form should have a submit button that clears out the form and stores the submitted information. 
Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

Finally, your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back what the monthly cost of salaries is.
